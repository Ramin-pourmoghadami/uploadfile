# uploadfile
This is an arbitrary challenge written procedurally. It does not have many features. It has features such as uploading a file, determining the allowed upload size, determining the allowed upload types, creating unique names to avoid copying files with duplicate names, displaying error or success messages.
If you want to use these source codes, don't forget to go to the config file and configure the required settings there. I am learning myself, so I would really appreciate it if you could help me to make the code better and cleaner
